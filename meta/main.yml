  By default, this role does nothing as all `*_state` variables are set to `ignored`.
  For the components you're interested in, set the `*_state` variables to `present` or `absent`.

  The following components are available:
    * [PyPI Server](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pypiserver), Python Repository.
      Variables: `relkit_pypiserver_*`.
      As the package doesn't not provide a service manifest,
      relkit ships the script `service_pypiserver.sh` to manage the service manually.
    * [Jenkins](http://jenkins-ci.org), Continuous Integration Service.
      Variables: `relkit_jenkins_*`.
    * [Aptly](http://www.aptly.info), Debian Repository.
      Variables: `relkit_aptly_*`.
      As the package doesn't not provide a service manifest,
      relkit ships the script `service_aptly.sh` to manage the service manually.
    * [Gitd](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-on-the-Server-Git-Daemon), Code repository.
      Variables: `relkit_gitd_*`.
      As the package doesn't not provide a service manifest,
      relkit ships the script `service_gitd.sh` to manage the service manually.

  **NOTICE:** Integration issues (firewalling, proxying…) are not managed by this role.
  Check out [ansible-role-syskit](https://github.com/fclaerho/ansible-role-syskit) as an option for this.
